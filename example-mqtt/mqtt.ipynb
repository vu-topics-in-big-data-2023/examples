        "MQTT is a lightweight publish/ subscribe messaging protocol. It can be used in IoT scenarios where the sensor data is communicated through a broker to a server which can be a database. In the previous ZMQ examples we have seen the actors communicating messages amongst themselves, there were no brokers involved. However, through the second assignment we have also created a broker between the two actors. The broker we had was very simple, it was acting as a pipeline to pass the messages. However in distributed applications, broker plays a very important role in scheduling messages, load balancing, etc. MQTT allows the luxury to have broker services online or on local host."
