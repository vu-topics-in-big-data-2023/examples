We adress this problem at three fronts - Data Analytics, Planning and analysis tool for understanding and projecting the impact of transportation choices, and developing scalable data stores that can enable cities to operate their own data lakes and analytics engines. As part of the project we also created an application called Transit Hub. Recently, we have been looking at the endogenous uncertainties and costs of transit operations as part of the the energy optimization project.\n"
